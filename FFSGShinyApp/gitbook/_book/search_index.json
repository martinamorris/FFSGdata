The Fatal Force Study Group \\(FFSG\\) was founded at the University of Washington \\(UW\\) by professor Martina Morris. Morris has a strong background in Sociology and Statistics and after joining an activism group called Not This Time she decided to start investigating fatal encounters with police, along with a group of UW undergraduate students. Since then the group has been joined by Professor Ben Marwick, an UW archaeology professor with a strong interest in statistics and R, as well as several more undergraduate students from both UW and neighboring University Western Washington University. 1.2 Our Mission UW FFSG’s mission is to bring justice and peace to communities most impacted by police brutality through a comprehensive data analysis. We are working to compile existing data sets on fatal encounters with police into one extensive data set. From there we are hoping to create an easy tool for anyone to investigate fatal encounters with police. Our tool will be in the form of a Shiny App which will include tables, graphs, and maps that users can directly interact with to better understand fatal encounters with police. "],

The name of ex cop is Philip M. Stinson. He has built database with 48 Google Alerts that Stinson set up in 2005. This system adds up to a data set of alleged police misconduct unmatched by anything created inside or outside of government which uses Google Alert to catch these cases. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/an-ex-cop-keeps-the-countrys-best-data-set-on-police-misconduct/ 2.5.2 Officer Down Memorial Page This data set is from the Officer Down Memorial Page, Inc., a non-profit organization that honors American law enforcement that died in the line of duty. The page provides an on-going archive of fatalities, including when, who, what, why, and how each death occurred. Many of the sources are very detailed, although requires one of the researchers from the UW FFRG to create an algorithm to format the data points so it is easier to aggregate with R. https://www.odmp.org 2.5.3 Mapping Police Violence Time covered: 2011, 2013- present In Mapping Police Violence has data that is represented on their site accounting for people killed by police since 2013.
