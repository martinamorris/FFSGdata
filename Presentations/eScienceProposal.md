If your proposal requires access to data, tell us about the datasets.
- We are principally working with three online sources of fatal police violence: Mapping Police Violence, Fatal Encounters, & Killed By Police, as well as data from the US Census Bureau. The police violence data sets range from 500 to 22000 observations. Fatal Encounters began recording information in 2000, and the other two sources began in 2013. Each has demographic data on the age, sex, and race of the vicitim (though all of these variables are frequenly missing), as well as the location of the death and auxillary information such as the cause of death and urls relevant to the victim.

Describe what is measured, the formats or file types currently used to store the data, and the approximate size of the data in terms of number bytes
- We have the recorded deaths caused by police violence. Each victim's death is recorded as a row in an R dataframe, which itself is generated from scraping one of three websites. The three dataframes contain roughly 8.6 MB of information across three dataframes containing a combined 33812 rows.

What is the current location of the data? (check all that apply if the data must be assembled from multiple sources) 
- A private repository on Github

Who has access to the data currently?
- There are 48 people who have access to the private repository
- Of those 48, only 5 are contributors
- Contributors include PL, Vaughn Johnson, Maddi Cummins, Jainul Vaghasia, and Wendy Liang
 
Are the data encumbered by license restrictions, IRB, FERPA, ITAR, or other legal restrictions?
- No

If necessary, is it permissible to copy or move the data to Studio resources, potentially including secure cloud resources? (Ignore technical constraints such as size and cost -- just consider legal or social restrictions.)
  Yes
